HD.HCI.EYRS,CC BY-4.0,Expected Years of School,Expected years of school is calculated as the sum of age-specific enrollment rates between ages 4 and 17. Age-specific enrollment rates are approximated using school enrollment rates at different levels: pre-primary enrollment rates approximate the age-specific enrolment rates for 4 and 5 year-olds; the primary rate approximates for 6-11 year-olds; the lower-secondary rate approximates for 12-14 year-olds; and the upper-secondary approximates for 15-17 year-olds. Most recent estimates are used.  Year of most recent primary enrollment rate used is shown  in data notes.,"World Bank staff estimates based on data from UNESCO Institute for Statistics, supplemented with data provided by World Bank staff.",https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by
HD.HCI.STNT,CC BY-4.0,Fraction of Children Under 5 Not Stunted,Percentage not stunted is calculated by subtracting stunting rates from 1. Most recent estimates are used.

HD.HCI.HLOS,CC BY-4.0,Harmonized Test Scores,"Harmonized test scores from major international student achievement testing programs.They are measured in TIMMS-equivalent units, where 300 is minimal attainment and 625 is advanced attainment. Most recent estimates are used.  Year of most recent estimate shown in data notes. 

Test scores from the following testing programs are included:
 TIMSS/PIRLS:  Refers to average of test scores from TIMSS (Trends in International Maths and Science Study) and PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study), both carried out by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. Data from each PIRLS round is moved to the year of the nearest TIMSS round and averaged with the TIMSS data.     
 PISA:  Refers to test scores from Programme for International Student Assessment
 PISA+TIMSS/PIRLS:  Refers to the average of these programs for countries and years where both are available
 SACMEQ:  Refers to test scores from Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality 
 PASEC: Refers to test scores from Program of Analysis of Education Systems
 LLECE:  Refers to test scores from Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education
 PILNA: Refers to test scores from Pacific Islands Literacy and Numeracy Assessment
 EGRA:  Refers to test scores from nationally-representative Early Grade Reading Assessments
